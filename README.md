# MobileShared
Shared code base for mobile applications. All interfaces, objects, common utility classes which do not have any platform specific code are defined here.

This allows porting applications from one mobile platform to another easier. For eg, Using Microsoft Research's Transpiler for java to C# can 
convert this code to C#.
